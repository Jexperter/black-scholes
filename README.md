This project provides an interactive Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model built with Streamlit. 
The app calculates Call and Put option prices based on user inputs like current asset price, strike price, time to maturity, volatility, and interest rate.
Users can also view how option prices change with different spot prices and volatility levels using heatmaps.
